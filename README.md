# Amazon Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **Amazon Price Prediction** project files, which aim to enhance pricing models for improved customer retention and increased market share. The project focuses on understanding customer behavior, analyzing pricing trends, and predicting prices using advanced machine learning models.

The analysis leverages datasets collected from Kaggle, and other sources, providing insights into competitive pricing strategies and customer purchasing behavior. The project utilizes time-series analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive visualizations to offer actionable recommendations for strategic pricing decisions.

## Methodology

### Data Sources:
- **Kaggle Dataset:** [Amazon Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset).

### Analytical Approach:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing customer purchasing behavior relative to pricing changes.
3. **Modeling:**
   - Developing machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for predictive analysis.
   - Implementing time-series analysis to understand price sensitivity.
4. **Evaluation:**
   - Using Mean Square Error (MSE) to evaluate model accuracy.
   - Visualizing results with Power BI to communicate findings effectively.
